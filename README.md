# AdaBoost-Classification
Built a machine learning model to predict the chance of survival using the Titanic dataset. Preprocessed the data, chose relevant characteristics, trained the model, and assessed its performance. Studied all the factors that impact passenger survival rates and the model's decision-making process using AdaBoost.
